# El Rondo Soccer Drill and its Benefits 

## What is El Rondo? 
El rondo is a practice drill in soccer where 4 - 9 players create a small circle with either 1 - 3 players in the middle of the circle. The objective is to keep the ball away from the people in the middle while they try to stop the drill by winning the ball back. The drill **does not** require a lot of space which forces the players to think fast and move quickly. This has a lot of benefits to imporving ball control and setting up passing lanes.
